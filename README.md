# ImageWeatherClassifier
MATLAB code to sort weather in images

.m files contain the code, and the dataset can be found, already sorted by weather type, in the dataset2 folder.

The 2 .mat files contain variables that can be loaded into MATLAB. The mainAlgo.mat file contains the trained network, whereas the processImages.mat is a helper.
